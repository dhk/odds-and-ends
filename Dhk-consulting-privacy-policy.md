DHK Consulting, LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is dedicated to creating applications that enhance and simplify everyday life. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is respected and protected. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard any personal information you may provide while using our applications. By using our applications, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We design our applications to require minimal personal information. However, in some cases, you may choose to provide us with information such as:

	•	Contact information (e.g., email) for communication purposes.
	•	Usage data to help improve the functionality of our applications.
	•	Information you voluntarily provide while using the application features.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Any information you provide to us is used exclusively to improve the functionality of our applications and to provide a better user experience. Specifically, we may use the information to:

	•	Respond to your inquiries or support requests.
	•	Improve or optimize the performance of the application.
	•	Provide features that are personalized for your use.

## 3. Data Storage

We do not store any personal information beyond what is necessary to support the core functionality of our applications. Any personal data you provide is retained only for as long as necessary to deliver the services or as required by law.

Once the data is no longer required, we take steps to permanently delete or anonymize it.

## 4. No Selling or Sharing of Personal Information

We respect your privacy and will never sell, rent, or trade any personal information you provide to third parties. We also do not share personal information with third parties unless it is essential for fulfilling the specific services you requested or as required by legal obligations.

Our applications may use cookies, analytics tools, or other technologies to enhance user experience and monitor usage. These technologies may collect non-personally identifiable information such as:

	•	Device type.
	•	Application usage metrics (e.g., feature usage, time spent on the app).

These data points are used only for improving the functionality and performance of our applications.

## 6. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the data you provide from unauthorized access, alteration, or misuse. However, no system is completely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Rest assured that we continually review and update our security practices to safeguard your information.

## 7. Third-Party Services

Our applications may integrate with third-party services (e.g., for analytics or payment processing). We ensure that any third-party service providers we work with adhere to strict privacy standards, but we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these providers as well.

## 8. Your Control Over Your Data

You are in control of the personal information you provide to us. At any time, you have the right to:

	•	Request access to your personal information.
	•	Request corrections or updates to any information.
	•	Request that your data be deleted from our systems.

If you wish to make such a request, please contact us using the information below.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

As we continue to improve our applications, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices. Any updates will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it periodically. The updated policy will take effect immediately upon posting.
